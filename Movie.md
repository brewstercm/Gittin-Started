# Movie 43
>   This movie is a bunch of random skits that don't particularly correlate with each other. It is told through an aspiring director that is trying to pitch his movie, so the skits don't particularly make sense. 
>   One of the skits focuses on a bachelor named David, played by Hugh Jackman. He is always wearing an expensive scarf. As is revealed when he goes on a date with a woman he met, he has a **legitimate** *ball chin*. As in his testicles are on his chin.
>   Another one of the skits revolves around Chris Pratt and his girlfriend. She wants to take things to the *next level*. For her, this means that she wants to be defecated on. So, after an internal struggle, Chris Pratt eats like 100 tacos. This scene ends with Chris Pratt running into the road, getting hit by a car, and exploding into a cloud of poop.
